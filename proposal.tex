\section{Excellence}

Reliable, autonomous, and smooth running machines is the most desirable state for any ma\-nu\-facturing plant.
To achieve, or approach, this utopian scenario it is essential to understand
the response of the machines to external forces so that
unstable operating conditions can be avoided or controlled.
To understand the response of a structure to external forces --- an activity known as System Identification ---
analysis of experimental data and modelling are essential components.

The general objective (GO) of this proposal is
\emph{to provide sound methods and algorithms for the analysis of experimental data
of structures with significant nonlinear effects.}
Here, we focus on structures encountered in Advance Manufacturing by metal removal operations,
like manufacturing of aerospace thin-walled components which
must comply with very high standards of quality and safety.

Unlike many successful data-driven models for image or language processing,
the amount of data available for training of models in Advance Manufacturing is much more limited.
To compensate for such scarcity of data (or relevant information),
physically motivated models are still in active use in the field.

Physical models of structures usually take the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mechanical_model}
    M\ddot{x} + C\dot{x} + Kx + G(t, x, \dot{x}) = f(t),
\end{equation}
where \(x\) are general coordinates of displacement from equilibrium,
\(f\) is an external force or excitation,
\(M\), \(C\), and \(K\) are matrices representing the mass, damping, and stiffness, and
\(G\) represents additional linear or nonlinear effects.
Linear models have been successfully applied in the modelling of many structures of practical interest, like machine tools.
However, in recent years, nonlinear effects are getting increasing attention
for, among other things, their relevance in lightweight structures \cite{martinelli24}, or
also for describing the dynamics of robots \cite{bjorn25}.

Nonlinear System Identification is an endless source of challenges.
I plan to approach the subject from a Bayesian point of view.
Bayesian statistics offers a rigorous answer to the question:
to what extent do the collected data support a model?
This is the scientific question we want to answer from our experiments, which
is in clear contrast with the popular Frequentist approach,
where a single model is assumed to be true, and
we have to find it by fitting parameters.
Bayesian statistics is particularly important when decisions must be made with little relevant information, and
we want to include modelling uncertainties into the predictions.


Bayes's theorem states that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:bayesT}
    p(M \,|\, D) \propto p(D \,|\, M)\,p(M),
\end{equation}
which means that the posterior, or conditional probability \(p(M \,|\, D)\) of a model \(M\) given the observed data or evidence \(D\), is
proportional to the likelihood, or conditional probability \(p(D \,|\, M)\) of the data given the model, times
the prior, or probability \(p(M)\) of the model.
The posterior \(p(M \,|\, D)\) is the central object to make predictions, and
Bayes's theorem is the tool to compute it.

To make Bayesian inference a viable alternative,
in agreement with the general objective (GO),
my first objective (O.1) is
\emph{to explore and apply methods to speed up the computation of the likelihood.}
This objective is roughly equivalent to efficiently solving \(x\) in \eqref{eq:mechanical_model}.
Two notable barriers that I must overcome are that
(i) the number of variables could be very large, and
(ii) standard solvers may be unacceptably slow.

To address (i),
existing techniques like substructuring, Reduction Order Models, and Nonlinear Normal Modes could be exploited.
On the other front,
standard solvers like Runge--Kutta schemes may be very slow, so
for (ii) other alternatives like Neural Networks offer an interesting alternative.
Solutions to both problems have been proposed, for example, in \cite{conti23}.

Prior and historical knowledge is valuable when there is little data, so
my second objective (O.2) is
\emph{to enable integration of prior knowledge through \(p(M)\).}
The Bayesian theoretical framework elegantly updates information using a previous posterior as a new prior.
Unfortunately,
technical issues make it difficult to realize Bayes's theorem in practice.
Recently, Neural Networks have been proposed as a fast
alternative to compute probability densities \cite{cai24},
so I will explore and further develop these kinds of algorithms.

Incidentally, O.2 naturally leads to researching algorithms for online updating,
which are important for structures whose parameters substantially vary in time, like for robots.
Hence, I set up as third objective (O.3)
\emph{to develop algorithms for online updating.}
The activities to reach O.2 are also included here, however,
I can optionally explore better methods for computing predictions exploiting decentralized and federated learning,
taking into account real computing capabilities in real industrial environments.

The fourth objective (O.4) is
\emph{to validate a methodology with a real experimental system.}

Submitted versions of the articles will be published in the 
Repository of the Academy's Library (REAL), as encouraged by MTA, and also in arXiv.
Depending on the publisher's policies,
the accepted or published versions will also be deposited in REAL.

For the scientific code,
I will give priority to open-source software, and
I will upload the code to public repositories, like GitHub.
Experimental datasets will be uploaded to the repository of the
Hungarian Research Network (HUN-REN).

\section{Impact}

Advance Manufacturing is a strategic sector for the Europe Union to
ensure the position of the region as an industrial, world leader \cite{industrialforum}.


\section{Implementation}

As a MSCA fellow,
I will be part of the MTA-BME Lendület Machine Tool Vibration Research Group, led by Zoltán Dombóvári, 
which functions within the Department of Applied Mecha\-nics.

Explain risks ...

The main objective of the Machine Tool Vibration Group is to
develop a framework for effective intervention of machining processes based on sensory data.
Among the strategic objectives,
robot dynamics and machining of slender workpieces feature prominently due to
the emergence of nonlinear behavior and time varying parameters,
which perfectly aligns with the objectives of this proposal,
although the approaches are different.

I will bring to the Group a Bayesian perspective which
they have not explored yet.
This new perspective will extend the Group's research portfolio
by endowing them with new tools for the rigorous statistical analysis of experimental data, and
additional theoretical knowledge to include uncertainty in their models.

The Group excels at the construction, simulation, and experimental validation of physical models of machining processes.
However, at times, their work depends on the application of heuristic algorithms or black-boxes
whose inner workings do not lie in their domain of expertise.
On the other hand, as a mathematician,
I rely on their expert knowledge and experience on machining processes.
This creates a perfect synergy because
I can complement them by opening and modifying black-boxes (like Neural Network architectures) tailored
for specific use-cases, while
steering my work toward physically relevant mathematical concepts.

In fact, I have already collaborated with members of the Group in the study of processes with varying parameters,
where they identified an interesting phenomenon in tool dynamics, and
I assisted them by providing rigorous mathematical foundations to their intuitions.
