\section{Excellence}

We are living the fourth industrial revolution,
and to stay competitive manufacturers are pushing industrial research towards smart factories which
can automatically and effectively respond to any event using data from multiple sensors.
However, to achieve, or approach, this utopian scenario one essential ingredient is to understand
the response of the machines to external forces so that
unstable operating conditions can be avoided or controlled.
To understand the response of a structure to external forces --- an activity known as System Identification ---
analysis of experimental data and modelling is indispensable.

The general objective (GO) of this proposal is
\emph{to provide sound methods and algorithms for the analysis of experimental data
of structures with significant nonlinear effects.}
This proposal focuses on structures encountered in Advanced Manufacturing by metal removal operations,
like manufacturing of aerospace thin-walled components which
must comply with very high standards of quality and safety.
Nonlinear System Identification is an endless source of challenges, and
a growing field of research \cite{noel17}.

Unlike many successful data-driven models for image or language processing,
the amount of high-quality data available for training of models in Advanced Manufacturing is much more limited.
To compensate for such scarcity,
physically motivated models are still used in the field.

Physical models of structures usually take the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mechanical_model}
    M\ddot{x} + C\dot{x} + Kx + G(t, x, \dot{x}) = f(t),
\end{equation}
where \(x\) are general coordinates of displacement from equilibrium,
\(f\) is an external force,
\(M\), \(C\), and \(K\) are matrices representing the mass, damping, and stiffness, and
\(G\) represents additional linear or nonlinear effects.
Linear models have been successfully applied in the modelling of many structures of practical interest, like machine tools.
However, in recent years, nonlinear effects are getting increasing attention
for, among other things, their relevance for lightweight structures \cite{martinelli24}, or
for describing robot dynamics with varying parameters \cite{bjorn25}.
I remark that machining robots are a field of current interest in Advanced Manufacturing \cite{verl19}.

As a methodological principle,
I plan to approach the subject from a Bayesian point of view, which
has not been thoroughly explored in this context.
Bayesian statistics offers a rigorous answer to the question:
to what extent do the collected data support a model?
This is the scientific question we want to answer from experiments, which
is in clear contrast with the popular Frequentist approach,
where a single model is assumed to be true, and
we have to find it by fitting parameters.
Bayesian statistics is particularly important when decisions must be made with limited data, and
we want to include modelling uncertainties into the predictions.

Bayes's theorem states that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:bayesT}
    p(M \,|\, D) \propto p(D \,|\, M)\,p(M),
\end{equation}
which means that the posterior, or conditional probability \(p(M \,|\, D)\) of a model \(M\) given the observed data or evidence \(D\), is
directly proportional to the likelihood, or conditional probability \(p(D \,|\, M)\) of the data given the model, times
the prior, or probability \(p(M)\) of the model.
The posterior \(p(M \,|\, D)\) is the central object to make predictions, and
Bayes's theorem is a method to compute it, but
the high computational cost makes Bayesian statistics unfeasible in many situations.
My ambitious plan is to make Bayesian inference a viable alternative,
in agreement with the GO, so
two strategic objectives are
\emph{to optimze the computation of the likelihood} (\obj{likelihood}), and
\emph{to enable model updating} (\obj{prior}).

The computation of the likelihood in O.~\ref{likelihood}
is roughly equivalent to efficiently solving \(x\) in \eqref{eq:mechanical_model} given the model parameters.
The computation of the posterior in \eqref{eq:bayesT} involves repeated solutions of \(x\) with different parameters, which
are then plugged into the likelihood.
At each iteration, \(x\) may be found using traditional methods like
Runge--Kutta schemes, however,
this could lead to an excessive computational overhead.

Recently, novel methods inspired by data-driven algorithms have given way to solvers which
 speed up the process dramatically.
Two popular methods are Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) \cite{pinn22}
and Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamics (SINDy) \cite{sindy19}.
In both cases
the idea is to train a model offline, and
then to use the trained model to retrieve solutions quickly.

PINNs solve differential equations by transforming them
into a loss minimization problem.
The solution \(x_\theta\) is approximated by a Neural Network (NN) with parameters \(\theta\), and
then \(\theta\) are adjusted by minimizing a loss function forcing
\(x_\theta\) to satisfy the differential equation.

SINDy replaces the dynamics by a sparse sum of nonlinear terms representing the main terms driving the system.
To improve the performance, the solution \(x\) is mapped by an autoencoder to a space of lower dimension, which
better represents the solution.
The initial cost of generating a dataset by solving the dynamics using standard numerical methods is later
recovered when new solutions must be quickly computed.

Another challenge when solving \eqref{eq:mechanical_model} is the
high dimensionality of \(x\) in many relevant cases.
To address this problem,
I can apply techniques like the Craig--Bamptom method, Reduction Order Models, Nonlinear Normal Modes \cite{cabre05}, among many other methods.
For instance, in \cite{conti23} Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was
used together with SINDy to efficiently track bifurcations in complex dynamical systems.

The Bayesian theoretical framework elegantly updates information using the posterior as the new prior when more data arrive.
The most reliable methods to explore the posterior are based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms \cite{gelman14}, which
require an analytic prior and then output samples from the posterior.
However, how can we reuse samples from the posterior as a new analytical prior?
Every time new data arrive, we are forced to re-train the model from scratch,
which is impractical.
This is the core of O.~\ref{prior}.

To deal with this problem sequential learning or importance sampling have been proposed.
NNs have also been proposed as a fast
alternative to computing probability densities.
For instance, in a problem of image reconstruction from partial or corrupted data \cite{cai24},
samples were transformed into an analytic prior using a method called Normalizing Flow, which
uses NNs to make a Gaussian distribution flow into another target distribution.

The last strategic objective (\obj{experiment}) is
\emph{to validate a methodology experimentally.}
Objectives \ref{likelihood} and \ref{prior} give us methods for inference and prediction,
but it still remains to design experimental tests.
There are plenty of possible mechanical structures, and a few benchmark problems are listed in \cite{schoukens17}.
For this objective, I will be assisted by my collaborators at the host and secondment institutions.
In particular, tests will be designed to measure the extent of nonlinear effects.
For example,
the response at different excitation amplitudes can be measured, or
frequency sweeps in both directions to detect backbone curves.

In agreement with Open Science policies,
I will upload submitted versions of the articles to the 
Repository of the Academy's Library (REAL), as encouraged by MTA, and also to arXiv.
Depending on the publisher's policies,
the accepted or published versions will be also deposited in the REAL;
no funds will be dedicated to the payment of open access fees.
For the scientific code,
I will give priority to open-source software, and
I will upload the code to public repositories, like GitHub.
Experimental datasets will be uploaded to the repository of the
Hungarian Research Network (HUN-REN).
For more details, see the Data Management Plan.


\section{Impact}

Nonlinear System Identification is a very complex problem, and
it may define my whole future academic career.
In the medium term,
securing this prestigious grant will increase my visibility and
probabilities of success in securing further funding for my research or scientific events.
Since this project will yield algorithms with industrial relevance,
in the future I could serve as a consultant in Advanced Manufacturing.

In the short term,
I will benefit from the interaction with the members of
the Machine Tool Vibration Research Group (MTV-RG) and their large list of collaborators.
The MTV-RG is known for their sensitivity when it comes to appreciate the mathematical depth behind manufacturing processes
(which is not always the case in engineering environments),
so the MTV-RG is the right place to learn and apply several skills in high demand inside and outside academia.

For example, I have only learned about NNs in theory, but
I lack practical experience, so
this project will serve as a hands-on training on NNs.
Also, I do not have much experience performing FEM simulations,
but for this project I may need to simulate complex structures, which
will force me to enhance my skills on this area.

Bayesian statistics is conceptually and computationally more demanding than the standard Frequentist statistics,
so researching in this area will make me stand out among my scientific peers.
It is worth noting that I will also gain more experience in data man\-age\-ment and analysis.
For example, I still have more to learn about FAIR principles and data versioning.

I plan to develop an open-source Python package ---
inspired by the principles of NumPy and similar scientific packages ---
where I will collect, organize, and maintain algorithms so that
other researchers or industrial R\&D teams can exploit them,
facilitating technology transfer.
Additionally, software maintenance demands several skills to enable an effective interaction with the users, like
a well-documented code, a webpage, and a pipeline from development to deployment.
For all this, I will take a course on good practices for code development.

Frequentist statistics is still the main method of analysis in many areas, even
in conditions where it cannot be fully justified.
This project will promote and enable the use of Bayesian statistics for the analysis of industrial processes
through the introduction of robust algorithms together with their implementation in use-cases.
As mentioned in the first section,
one of the bottlenecks in the application of Bayesian methods is
the difficulty of converting a posterior into a prior for further sampling.
However, this project seeks to solve this problem,
at least for specific cases that may hint at more general method for future research.

The new theoretical frameworks and methodologies developed during this project will
contribute to the creation of new tools for monitoring, control, and diagnosis of machining processes where
nonlinear effects and varying parameters play an important role.
Furthermore, the use of Bayesian statistics allows quantifying model uncertainties,
which renders more reliable predictions than usual Frequentist methods.

Advanced Manufacturing is a strategic sector
for maintaining Europe's position as a competitive global player.
Autonomous factories performing at optimum levels while running at the highest standards of quality and safety
is the goal of any company that expects to stay competitive.
Modal Analysis has guided the ma\-nu\-facturing industry for years in approaching this goal, but
it only applies to linear structures, which not only limit its scope of applicability but
also limit our ability to design and deploy nonlinear structures for which
we do not understand their response.
I envision future standard algorithms based on the results of this project.

Research outputs will be disseminated through the usual scientific channels:
articles in re\-pu\-table peer-reviewed journals, and
posters and talks in scientific events; in particular,
ISMA or USD conferences in Leuven, Belgium, will be considered.
Additionally, the research outputs will be promoted through the webpages of the Department of Applied Mechanics and the MTV-RG.
I will also post to my webpage blog entries featuring my research or interesting facts in a more engaging and less formal language for a broader scientific audience.

To grow and strengthen my collaborative network,
I will organize at least one workshop on Nonlinear System Identification and Bayesian statistics to bring together researchers
from both fields.


\section{Implementation}

I will be part of the MTA-BME Lendület MTV-RG, led by Zoltán Dombóvári, 
which functions within the Department of Applied Mecha\-nics.
The main objective of the MTV-RG is to
develop a framework for effective intervention of machining processes based on sensory data, and
robot dynamics and machining of slender workpieces feature prominently
among their strategic objectives.
These phenomena are characterized by the emergence of nonlinear behavior and time varying parameters,
which perfectly aligns with the objectives of this proposal,
although the approaches are different.
A secondment is planned at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden,
under the supervision of Andreas Archenti.

I will bring to the MTV-RG a Bayesian perspective which
they have not explored yet.
This new perspective will extend the MTV-RG's research portfolio
by endowing them with new tools for the rigorous statistical analysis of experimental data, and
additional theoretical knowledge for including uncertainty into their models.

The MTV-RG excels at the construction, simulation, and experimental validation of physical models of machining processes.
However, at times, their work depends on heuristic algorithms or black-boxes
whose inner workings do not lie in their domain of expertise.
On the other hand, as a mathematician,
I rely on their expert knowledge and experience on machining processes.
This creates a perfect synergy because
I can complement them by opening and modifying black-boxes (like NN architectures) tailored
for specific use-cases, while
steering my work toward physically relevant mathematical concepts.

For computing, personal computers are expected to meet the demands for this project, but
even if they do not,
cloud computing services like Azure or AWS should cover the demand at a reasonable cost (below €1.000 for the whole project).
The MTV-RG has access to software like Matlab, Wolfram Mathematica, and Ansys, so
no additional cost is expected for software licenses, but it is for training (below €1.000).

For experimental activities,
the MTV-RG has access to the Department's laboratory, which
is equipped with the necessary equipment and machines for multiple tests.
The laboratory provides several sensors and exciters, data acquisition systems, and a 3-axes CNC milling center.
Also, the KTH (secondment institution) has fully equipped laboratories.

Collaborators in the Basque Country, Spain, are:
the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM);
the Aeronautics Advanced Manufacturing Center (CFAA); and
IDEKO.
In Hungary, Z. Dombóvári also collaborates with researchers from Bosch.
Hence, our collaborators offer access to additional equipment and data.
