\section*{Professional career in narrative form}

I completed my B.Sc. in Chemistry (April 2011) and my M.Sc. in mathematics (April 2014) at
the National University of Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia.
The main topic of my Master's thesis was the mathematical theory of elastic shells, and,
as a side project, I worked on simulations of spatial patterns of oscillating chemical reactions using \CC.

I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics at the same university
under the direction of Javier Ramos Maravall (today at the Autonomous University of Madrid, Spain), and
I did a secondment (Jan. - Jun., 2017) at
the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Madrid, Spain.
The topic of my thesis was harmonic analysis, an area of pure mathematics.
Harmonic analysis stu\-dies, among other things, the theoretical foundations of signal decompositions
like the Fourier transform or the wavelet transform, which
are nowadays important tools for signal processing in engineering.

After finishing my Ph.D. --- and a brief period of unemployment --- I was hired in May 2019 by the Basque Center of Applied Mathematics (BCAM) in Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain.
I conducted research in pure mathematics, mainly
harmonic analysis and applications to other fields of mathematics
like inverse problems or partial differential equations.

By the beginning of 2022 I started feeling dissatisfied with the abstract nature of my research, and
I began to look by myself for industrial problems where my skills could be relevant.
Around this time (March 2022) I started programming again, and
I even taught a course on Git for mathematicians in the writing of papers; see \url{https://gitlab.bcamath.org/fponce/git-for-mathematicians/}

By the Fall of 2022, Luis Vega, a very well-known researcher in harmonic analysis at BCAM,
introduced me to Norberto López de Lacalle,
the scientific director of the Aeronautics Advanced Manufacturing Centre (CFAA).
This was the beginning of a new era for me, and,
as an introduction to the subjects I would work in,
I collaborated with Michael Barto\v{n}, a researcher in BCAM who collaborates with CFAA,
in a project on the smoothness of
surfaces manufactured by flank milling in 5-axis CNC machines.

After a successful collaboration with M. Barto\v{n},
I moved my office to CFAA. However,
I had a tough time there because I did not find
where my research could fit in, and
it was my first experience surrounded by engineers, which
talked a different language than mine.
Eventually, I had to adjust to their problems and
get into fields of mathematics I was not expert on, but
which are relevant for my colleagues at CFAA.

Among the many subjects I explored,
I worked on Delay Differential Equations (DDE), which
appear in the study of chatter in machining by metal removal.
I had the fortune to discuss the topic with Jokin Muñoa (IDEKO),
who introduced me to Zoltán Dombóvári.
He posed a question to me about stability of tool dynamics where parameters changed slowly,
which was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration, and
he invited me to work with him and his group at
the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME),
where I spent the Fall of 2023 (Oct. - Nov.).

I also started another important project
when a colleague at CFAA proposed that
I collaborated with them in a problem suggested by ITP Areo, an important company in Spain.
This forced me to learn new skills and allowed me
to gain experience in the management of data.
In particular,
I found that Bayesian statistics was the right point of view for the project.

Regarding supervision,
I co-directed, with Luis Vega, the Bachelor's thesis of Markel Irastorza at the University of the Basque Country (EHU) on
the stability of DDEs.
Currently, I am the supervisor of Reinaldo Espina-Navarro,
a research technician at BCAM, and
soon I will start supervising a Master's student in mathematics.

At present,
I continue working at BCAM within a collaboration agreement with CFAA,
and I am interested in Experimental Modal Analysis,
where I am revisiting several aspects using recent mathematical tools.
